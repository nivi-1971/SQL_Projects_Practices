Institute: Besant Technologies

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Sample Superstore dataset using SQL to uncover insights related to sales, profit, discounts, customer behavior, and regional performance.
The goal was to perform end-to-end SQL exploration, aggregation, and business insight generation that can support data-driven decision-making.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes sales transactions with fields such as:

Ship Mode – Delivery type (Standard, Second Class, First Class, Same Day)

Segment – Consumer, Corporate, Home Office

Location – City, State, Region

Product Info – Category, Sub-Category

Sales & Profit

Quantity, Discount

This dataset is widely used for business analytics and is ideal for SQL-based exploration.

📈 Insights Identified
Over-discounted sub-categories are causing profit losses.
                                                                                  
Technology category shows strong profitability, especially in the West region.
                                                                
South region underperforms and needs targeted sales strategy.
                                                                          
High-sales but low-profit cities need optimization in pricing/discounts.
                                                                                  
Profitability varies across shipping modes, requiring logistics adjustments.

Cities with bulk purchases offer opportunities for loyalty programs.

🎯 Recommendations
Reduce high discounts and optimize pricing.  
                                                              
Focus on Technology and other high-profit categories.
                                                        
Improve sales strategy in low-performing regions.
                                                    
Encourage customers toward profitable shipping modes.

Strengthen partnerships and bundle offers in high-quantity cities.
